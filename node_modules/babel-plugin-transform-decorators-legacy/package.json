  "readme": "\n\n# Babel Legacy Decorator plugin\n\nThis is a plugin for Babel 6 that is meant to replicate the old decorator behavior from\nBabel 5 in order to allow people to more easily transition to Babel 6 without needing to\nbe blocked on updates to the decorator proposal or for Babel to re-implement it.\n\n## Babel >= 7.x\n\nThis plugin is specifically for Babel 6.x. If you're using Babel 7, this plugin is not for you.\nBabel 7's `@babel/plugin-proposal-decorators` officially supports the same logic that this\nplugin has, but integrates better with Babel 7's other plugins. You can enable this with\n\n```json\n{\n  \"plugins\": [\n    [\"@babel/plugin-proposal-decorators\", { \"legacy\": true }],\n  ]\n}\n```\nin your Babel configuration. Note that `legacy: true` is specifically needed if you\nwant to get the same behavior as `transform-decorators-legacy` because there\nare newer versions of the decorator specification coming out, and they do not\nbehave the same way as this plugin does.\n\n\n## Installation & Usage\n\n    $ npm install --save-dev babel-plugin-transform-decorators-legacy\n\nAdd the following line to your .babelrc file:\n\n    {\n        \"plugins\": [\"transform-decorators-legacy\"]\n    }\n\n#### NOTE: Order of Plugins Matters!\nIf you are including your plugins manually and using `transform-class-properties`, make sure that `transform-decorators-legacy` comes *before* `transform-class-properties`.\n\n```js\n/// WRONG\n\n\"plugins\": [\n  \"transform-class-properties\",\n  \"transform-decorators-legacy\"\n]\n\n// RIGHT\n\n\"plugins\": [\n  \"transform-decorators-legacy\",\n  \"transform-class-properties\"\n]\n```\n\n## Why \"legacy\"?\n\nDecorators are still only a relatively new proposal, and they are (at least currently) still\nin flux. Many people have started to use them in their original form, where each decorator\nis essentially a function of the form\n\n    function(target, property, descriptor){}\n\nThis form is very likely to change moving forward, and Babel 6 did not wish to support\nthe older form when it was known that it would change in the future. As such, I created this\nplugin to help people transition to Babel 6 without requiring them to drop their decorators\nor requiring them to wait for the new proposal update and then update all their code.\n\n## Best Effort\n\nThis plugin is a best effort to be compatible with Babel 5's transpiler output, but there\nare a few things that were difficult to reproduce, and a few things that were simply incorrect\nin Babel 5 with respect to the decorators proposal.\n\nTwo main things to mention as differences, though not things you are likely to encounter:\n\n1. Decorators expressions are evaluated top to bottom, and executed bottom to top. e.g.\n\n    ```\n    function dec(id){\n        console.log('evaluated', id);\n        return (target, property, descriptor) => console.log('executed', id);\n    }\n\n    class Example {\n        @dec(1)\n        @dec(2)\n        method(){}\n    }\n    ```\n\n    In Babel 5, this would output:\n\n    ```\n    evaluated 2\n    evaluated 1\n    executed 2\n    executed 1\n    ```\n\n    With this plugin, it will result in:\n\n    ```\n    evaluated 1\n    evaluated 2\n    executed 2\n    executed 1\n    ```\n\n    which is what the spec dictates as the correct behavior and was incorrect in Babel 5.\n\n2. Static class property initializers are evaluated once up front.\n\n    If you decorate a static class property, you will get a descriptor with an `initializer` property.\n    However whereas with Babel 5 this could be re-executed multiple times with potentially differing\n    results, `decorators-legacy` will precompute the value and return an initializer that will\n    return that value. e.g.\n\n    ```\n    function dec(target, prop, descriptor){\n        let {initializer} = descriptor;\n        delete descriptor.initializer;\n        delete descriptor.writable;\n\n        descriptor.get = function(){\n            return initializer.call(this);\n        };\n    }\n\n    var i = 0;\n\n    class Example {\n        @dec\n        static prop = i++;\n    }\n    ```\n\n    In Babel 5, every access to `prop` would increment `i`.\n    In Babel 6, the very first value of `i` will be cached for future `initializer` calls.\n\n    The spec is a little vague around how initializers work for repeat calls, and I'd consider\n    calling an `initializer` multiple times to be a mistake in general, so hopefully this will\n    not cause anyone trouble.\n\n## License\n\nMIT (c) 2015\n",
